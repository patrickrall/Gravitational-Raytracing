# Gravitational Raytracing

This is the code written by Devanshu Panchal and Patrick Rall for our final project in Dr. Richard Matzner's General Relativity course, Spring 2018.

Metrics are inputted in baking.py. Sympy is used to compute the Christoffel symbols, and the geodesic equation solver is baked into a .metric file. The actual ray tracing is performed in trace.py, which contains lots of switches for different visualizations.

I hope somebody finds this useful...
